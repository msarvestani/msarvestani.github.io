# Teaching and Organizing:

I was the lead organizer for the inaugural virtual [Tree shrew Meeting](https://mpfi.org/treeshrewmeeting/) in March 2021 to bring together 90+ neuroscientists using the tree shrew animal model. An extended in-person meeting is planned for 2022. These meetings are supported with a grant from the National Eye Institute.

I'm involed in [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a three week virtual computational neuroscience summer school designed to be accessible to students world-wide. In 2020, I served on the executive committee and contributed to the production of tutorials and running professional development sessions. In 2021, I'll continue my volunteer work with NMA as the Chief Instruction Officer by working with a group of great volunteers on TA selection, training, and mangement. NMA served 1700 students in 2020 and will reach many more through freely available [course material](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus). 

I've also been involved in the Cold Spring Harbor Summer School on [Neural Data Science](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-neudata&year=19), as a TA in 2015 and 2017 and a co-instructor in 2019.

From 2013-2016 I had the very fun role of 'Science Fair Mentor' and Judge for Philadelphia 6th-8th graders. Prior to that, I worked for several years as an SAT tutor for high-school students.
