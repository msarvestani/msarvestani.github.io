# Teaching and Organizing:

I organize Tree Shrew Discovery [Tree Shrew Discovery](treeshrewdiscovery.com), a meeting that brings together neuroscientists interested in the tree shrew as a model organism. Our first virtual meeting was in March 2021, and attended by 90+ neuroscientists from the states and beyond. An extended in-person meeting is planned for September 25-28th, 2022 at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. These meetings are supported with a grant from the National Eye Institute.

I'm involed in [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a three week virtual computational neuroscience summer school designed to be accessible to students world-wide. In 2020, I served on the executive committee and contributed to the production of tutorials and running professional development sessions. In 2021, I was the Chief Instruction Officer and led a group of great volunteers on TA selection, training, and mangement. NMA has served thousands of students so far and will reach many more through freely available [course material](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus). 

I've also been involved in the Cold Spring Harbor Summer School on [Neural Data Science](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-neudata&year=19), as a TA in 2015 and 2017 and a co-instructor in 2019.

From 2013-2016 I had the very fun role of 'Science Fair Mentor' and Judge for Philadelphia 6th-8th graders. Prior to that, I worked for several years as an SAT tutor for high-school students.
