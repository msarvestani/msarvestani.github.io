I'm a post-doc at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, working with David Fitzpatrick on the tree shrew visual system. My background and training are in engineering and modeling, although these days I'm an experimental systems neuroscientist.

My goal is to develop an understanding of the the visual system in the context of an animal's specific visual experience. Many factors influence visual experience across an animal's life-time, including the structure of the retina, the environment, and how the animal moves around in its environment. I've studied the visual system of mice, cats, and tree shrews, trying to determine how the structure of visual circuits transforms incoming visual inputs. More recently, I've considered how these transformations are shaped by, and shape, an animal's specific movement patterns. 
 
I firmly believe that the most efficient path towards understanding the brain is to use mulitple animal models, and leverage the unique advantages each organism offers.  Over the past few years, I've worked on establishing the tree shrew as an animal model of the extrastriate visual system. In my most recent [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627321007261) I discovered a unique map of the retina in the secondary visual cortex (V2) of tree shrews that overturned a lot of working assumptions about cortical representations of the sensory surface. My findings in tree shrew helped to make sense of similar data in ferrets, squirrels, and possums and produced a few exciting predictions that can be tested in primates. I'm looking for a department that can support my cross-species efforts to produce an understanding of the visual sytem more faithful to our experience as moving animals.
