I'm a post-doc at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, working with David Fitzpatrick on the tree shrew visual system. 

I want to understand how the visual system becomes perfectly suited for to an animal's specific visual experience. A lot of factors influence visual experience across an animal's life-time, like the structure of the retina, the environment, and how the animal moves around in its environment. I've studied the visual system of mice, cats, and tree shrews, trying to determine how cortical connections transform visual inputs. More recently, I've started to think about how these transformations are shaped by, and shape, an animal's specific movement patterns. 
 
I think the most clever, and interesting, path towards understanding the brain includes multiple animals, and leveraging the quirks and advantages each one comes with.  Over the past couple of years, I've worked on establishing the tree shrew as a model of the extrastriate visual system. I [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627321007261) a unique map of the retina in the secondary visual cortex (V2) of tree shrews that overturned a lot of working assumptions about cortical representations of the sensory surface. My findings in tree shrew helped to make sense of similar strange observations in ferrets, squirrels, and possums and produced a few exciting predictions that can be tested in primates.

I'm looking for a department that can get behind my studies of the visual system in the context of the moving body it lives in.
